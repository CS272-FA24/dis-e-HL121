1. Create an empty list called "sorted" which is used to store the sorted books. Name book list as "books". If there  are no empty boxes next to "sorted", skip to step 4, otherwise continue to step 2.
2. Follow the position of the first letter of all the books in the alphabet to find the first one (case insensitive). Write the book name into the "sorted" list.  Cross off the name of this book.
3. Go back to step 1.
4. Return the "sorted list" as output.
